1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am on another computer. Or, when I do not have sufficient privileges on my current computer.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might get mistakes in GitHub transferred to my local repository and vice versa.
Pulling overwrites all local commits that have not been pushed. 
Staying up-to-date with my remote might take up bandwidth.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork - Clone a repository on GitHub.
Clone - Clone a repository locally or from GitHub to local.
Branch - Create a new branch locally.

Fork to copy a repository I don't have permission to change.
Clone to make a copy of a repository.
Branch to try out something different in code.
