1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git file. I need to initialize a repository so that I can start using it.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is the place where I put changes that I would like to finally commit. It is not the repository, but is not also where I have been working on.
It is valuable since it helps me commit only what I need. Not everything.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

It will help me to see which files I have modified and thus how I should organize my commits.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When I have great changes in mind that I want to implement on my code. Branches will help me put each change in a logical division so I can know what changes I have made.

5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They help me to see the commits as a tree not an abstract thing.
